the sequence of the first 71 commands in weird.in will result in the following tree
           ┌ b 5 ┤
     ┌ b 5 ┤
                 ┌ b 4 ┤
           └ r 4 ┤
                 └ b 4 ┤
 b 4 ┤
                 ┌ b 3 ┤
                       └ r 3 ┤
           ┌ b 3 ┤
                 └ b 3 ┤
                       └ r 3 ┤
     └ r 3 ┤
                 ┌ b 3 ┤
           └ b 3 ┤
                       ┌ b 2 ┤
                 └ r 2 ┤
                       └ b 1 ┤

From here, removing the value 3 will somehow completely unbalance the tree, seeing as the next command "re 3" will result in this:

                 ┌ b 5 ┤
           ┌ b 5 ┤
                       ┌ b 4 ┤
                 └ r 4 ┤
                       └ b 4 ┤
     ┌ b 4 ┤
                 ┌ b 3 ┤
                       └ r 3 ┤
           └ b 3 ┤
                 └ b 3 ┤
                       └ r 3 ┤
 b 3 ┤
     └ b 3 ┤
                 ┌ b 2 ┤
           └ b 2 ┤
                 └ b 1 ┤

As one can see, the lower (left) node of root has no right child, breaking the invariant of the RBST. The next command (re 1) will therefore encounter an assertion error
